## Key Features

### Open Source Audio Libraries
The system integrates with multiple royalty-free and Creative Commons audio sources:

- **Freesound**: Over 500,000 sound effects and field recordings

- **Free Music Archive**: Diverse collection of music under CC licenses

### Custom Upload Capabilities
Content creators can upload their own audio files when they need something specific:

- Custom tagging and categorization
- License management for proper attribution

### Audio Preview
The built-in audio preview system lets users:

- Test sounds before selecting them
- Compare different options
- Understand how audio will enhance their content

### Search and Filtering
The interface includes powerful tools to find the perfect audio:

- Text search across titles and tags
- Source filtering
- Duration and license filtering
- Tag-based browsing

## Integration with Content Types

### Visual Novels
- Background music for scenes
- Transition sounds between scenes
- Character-specific sound effects
- Ambient background sounds

### Mini-Games

## Implementation Notes

### API Keys
You'll need to obtain API keys for:
- Freesound API
- MusOpen API
- Free Music Archive API

### Backend Requirements
The system expects a backend endpoint that can:
- Store uploaded audio files
- Serve audio assets
- Manage metadata

### Player Implementation
The client app will need to implement:
- Background music players
- Sound effect triggers
- Volume controls
- Audio preloading

## Next Steps

1. **Obtain API Keys**: Register for developer access to the audio services
2. **Configure Backend**: Set up storage for uploaded audio files
3. **Implement in App**: Add audio playback capabilities to your client app
4. **Add Volume Controls**: Create user settings for audio levels

This audio library integration transforms your interactive content by adding an essential sensory dimension, making experiences more immersive and engaging while keeping implementation simple for content creators.
