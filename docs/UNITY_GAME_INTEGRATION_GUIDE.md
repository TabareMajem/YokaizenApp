# Unity Games Integration Guide for YokaizenApp

## üéÆ **Overview**

This guide explains how to integrate your Unity games (`VoiceBridge` and `VoiceBridgePolished`) into the Flutter YokaizenApp.

## üìÅ **Current Setup**

Your Unity games are located in:
- `games/game1/VoiceBridge/` - Classic VoiceBridge game
- `games/game2/VoiceBridgePolished/` - Enhanced version with improved graphics

## üîß **Flutter Integration Completed**

‚úÖ **Flutter-Side Integration:**
- Unity Game Service (`lib/services/unity_game_service.dart`)
- Games Selection Screen (`lib/screens/games/view/games_screen.dart`)
- Unity Game Player Screen (`lib/screens/games/view/unity_game_screen.dart`)
- Navigation integration (Games tab added to bottom navigation)
- Home screen shortcuts added
- Dependency added to `pubspec.yaml`

## üéØ **Next Steps: Unity Build Configuration**

### **Step 1: Prepare Unity Projects**

#### **For VoiceBridge Classic:**
1. Open Unity Hub and add the project: `games/game1/VoiceBridge/`
2. Open the project in Unity
3. Go to **File ‚Üí Build Settings**
4. Add your game scenes to "Scenes In Build"
5. Switch platform to **Android** or **iOS**

#### **For VoiceBridge Polished:**
1. Open Unity Hub and add the project: `games/game2/VoiceBridgePolished/`
2. Open the project in Unity
3. Go to **File ‚Üí Build Settings**
4. Add your game scenes to "Scenes In Build"
5. Switch platform to **Android** or **iOS**

### **Step 2: Install Flutter Unity Widget in Unity**

1. **Download flutter-unity-widget package:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juicycleff/flutter-unity-view-widget.git
   ```

2. **Copy Unity files to your projects:**
   - Copy `unity/FlutterUnityIntegration/` to both:
     - `games/game1/VoiceBridge/Assets/FlutterUnityIntegration/`
     - `games/game2/VoiceBridgePolished/Assets/FlutterUnityIntegration/`

### **Step 3: Configure Unity Projects for Flutter**

#### **Add GameManager Script:**

Create `Assets/Scripts/GameManager.cs` in both projects:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using FlutterUnityIntegration;
using System.Collections;

public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Game Settings")]
    public bool soundEnabled = true;
    public bool hapticFeedback = true;
    public string difficulty = "normal";
    
    [Header("Game State")]
    public int currentScore = 0;
    public int currentLevel = 1;
    public bool isGameActive = false;
    
    private void Start()
    {
        // Initialize game
        Debug.Log("VoiceBridge Game Manager started");
        SendMessageToFlutter("game_initialized", "Game is ready to play");
    }
    
    // Called from Flutter
    public void InitializeGame(string data)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Initializing game with data: {data}");
        
        // Parse Flutter data (JSON)
        try
        {
            var gameData = JsonUtility.FromJson<GameInitData>(data);
            soundEnabled = gameData.settings.sound_enabled;
            hapticFeedback = gameData.settings.haptic_feedback;
            difficulty = gameData.settings.difficulty;
            
            SendMessageToFlutter("game_ready", "Game initialized successfully");
        }
        catch (System.Exception e)
        {
            Debug.LogError($"Failed to parse game data: {e.Message}");
        }
    }
    
    // Called from Flutter
    public void StartGame()
    {
        Debug.Log("Starting game...");
        isGameActive = true;
        currentScore = 0;
        currentLevel = 1;
        
        // Start your game logic here
        SendMessageToFlutter("game_started", $"{{\"level\": {currentLevel}, \"score\": {currentScore}}}");
    }
    
    // Called from Flutter
    public void PauseGame()
    {
        Debug.Log("Pausing game...");
        isGameActive = false;
        Time.timeScale = 0f;
        
        SendMessageToFlutter("game_paused", "Game paused");
    }
    
    // Called from Flutter
    public void ResumeGame()
    {
        Debug.Log("Resuming game...");
        isGameActive = true;
        Time.timeScale = 1f;
        
        SendMessageToFlutter("game_resumed", "Game resumed");
    }
    
    // Called from Flutter
    public void RestartGame()
    {
        Debug.Log("Restarting game...");
        currentScore = 0;
        currentLevel = 1;
        Time.timeScale = 1f;
        
        // Restart your game logic here
        SendMessageToFlutter("game_restarted", "Game restarted");
    }
    
    // Called from Flutter
    public void ExitGame()
    {
        Debug.Log("Exiting game...");
        isGameActive = false;
        Time.timeScale = 1f;
        
        SendMessageToFlutter("game_exited", "Game exited");
    }
    
    // Game events (call these from your game logic)
    public void OnScoreUpdated(int newScore)
    {
        currentScore = newScore;
        SendMessageToFlutter("score_updated", $"{{\"score\": {currentScore}}}");
    }
    
    public void OnLevelCompleted(int level, float completionTime)
    {
        currentLevel = level + 1;
        SendMessageToFlutter("level_completed", $"{{\"level\": {level}, \"completion_time\": {completionTime}}}");
    }
    
    public void OnGameCompleted(int finalScore)
    {
        isGameActive = false;
        SendMessageToFlutter("game_completed", $"{{\"final_score\": {finalScore}, \"total_levels\": {currentLevel}}}");
    }
    
    // Helper method to send messages to Flutter
    private void SendMessageToFlutter(string type, string data)
    {
        var message = new
        {
            type = type,
            data = data,
            timestamp = System.DateTime.Now.ToString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffZ")
        };
        
        string jsonMessage = JsonUtility.ToJson(message);
        UnityMessageManager.Instance.SendMessageToFlutter(jsonMessage);
    }
}

// Data classes for JSON parsing
[System.Serializable]
public class GameInitData
{
    public string user_id;
    public string app_version;
    public string language;
    public GameSettings settings;
}

[System.Serializable]
public class GameSettings
{
    public bool sound_enabled;
    public bool haptic_feedback;
    public string difficulty;
}
```

#### **Add to Your Existing Game Scripts:**

In your existing `VoiceBridgeGame.cs` scripts, add references to GameManager:

```csharp
public class VoiceBridgeGame : MonoBehaviour
{
    private GameManager gameManager;
    
    private void Start()
    {
        gameManager = FindObjectOfType<GameManager>();
        // Your existing start logic
    }
    
    // When score changes
    private void UpdateScore(int newScore)
    {
        // Your existing score logic
        if (gameManager != null)
            gameManager.OnScoreUpdated(newScore);
    }
    
    // When level is completed
    private void CompleteLevel(int level, float time)
    {
        // Your existing level completion logic
        if (gameManager != null)
            gameManager.OnLevelCompleted(level, time);
    }
    
    // When game is completed
    private void CompleteGame(int finalScore)
    {
        // Your existing game completion logic
        if (gameManager != null)
            gameManager.OnGameCompleted(finalScore);
    }
}
```
